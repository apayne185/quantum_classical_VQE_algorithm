# Hybrid Quantum-Classical VQE Middleware

**Quantum-as-a-Service (QAAS) stack for VQE workloads with automatic hardware detection, MPI parallelism, and pluggable CPU / GPU / QPU backends.**

Runs a molecular ground-state VQE from the same Python API on:
- **CPU-only** — any Linux/Mac laptop (Docker)
- **NVIDIA GPUs** — consumer (GTX 1650) → workstation (RTX 6000 Ada) → datacenter (A100, H100), via cuStateVec
- **IBM Quantum QPUs** — Heron/Eagle processors via `qiskit-ibm-runtime` EstimatorV2
- **MPI cluster** — Slurm-managed HPC or single-host multi-rank

Designed as reusable middleware: `HardwareProfile.detect()` auto-selects the best backend, precision policy adapts to problem size, and every run is reproducible from a clean install via Docker (`make build && make trial`) or bare-metal conda (`bash scripts/install_native.sh`).

<sub>Originally developed as a BCSAI thesis at IE University (Anna Payne, supervised by Prof. Oscar Diez). Continuing development targets journal publication as reusable QAAS middleware.</sub>

## Quickstart — pick your deployment path

### Path A — Docker (recommended for reviewers, local development, cloud GPUs)

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd quantum_classical_VQE_algorithm
make build                           # ~10 min first time; CUDA 12.6 + OpenMPI + Python 3.11 image
make trial NP=2                      # 7-layer diagnostic; passes 7/7 on any laptop (CPU fallback)
make run NP=2                        # Full 4-molecule benchmark (simulator)
```

Same image runs GPU-accelerated on any NVIDIA host with the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) installed (add `--gpus all` — already in the Makefile targets).

### Path B — Native conda on a bare-metal HPC (no Docker)

```bash
bash scripts/install_native.sh       # miniforge env + CMake build + smoke test
# Then submit via Slurm:
make slurm-trial                     # 7-layer test on a compute node
make slurm-run                       # Full benchmark on 1 GPU
make slurm-multi-seed                # 3-seed statistical run for publication error bars
```

Tested on the IE University capstone cluster (Debian 13, Slurm, CUDA 12.4, RTX 6000 Ada). Adapt `scripts/slurm_*.sh` partition names/times for other sites.

### Path C — Interactive walkthrough

See [`template.py`](template.py) for a step-by-step Python walkthrough. See [`MOLECULES.md`](MOLECULES.md) for all available built-in molecules.

## Configuration API

Everything is controlled through environment variables — no code changes needed to switch hardware, precision, or workload.

| Variable | Values | Effect |
|----------|--------|--------|
| `USE_GPU` | `yes` \| `no` | Force GPU on or off. Default: auto-detect via `HardwareProfile` |
| `BACKEND` | `simulator` \| `ibm_cloud` | Simulator (default) or cloud QPU |
| `VQE_PRECISION` | `auto` \| `fp32` \| `fp64` | Statevector precision. Default: auto (fp64 for chemistry) |
| `VQE_BACKEND` | `auto` \| `custatevec` \| `aer_gpu` \| `aer_cpu` | Force a specific simulator backend |
| `MOLECULES` | space-separated names | Subset of `H2 LiH BeH2 H2O NH3` (default: all four benchmark set) |
| `SEED` | integer | SPSA random seed (default 42) — override for multi-seed statistical runs |
| `MAX_ITERS` | integer | Cap on VQE iterations per molecule (default: `max(200, 8×n_params)`) |
| `NP` | integer | MPI rank count (also set via `sbatch --ntasks=N`) |
| `IBM_QUANTUM_TOKEN` | string | Required for `BACKEND=ibm_cloud`. See IBM Quantum Setup below. |
| `IBM_QUANTUM_INSTANCE` | CRN string | Required for `BACKEND=ibm_cloud` — from the same IBM Cloud account as the token |
| `IBM_QUANTUM_BACKEND` | backend name | e.g. `ibm_marrakesh`, `ibm_torino`, `ibm_kyiv` |

Example — run only H₂O with the GPU on 4 ranks, seed 43:
```bash
USE_GPU=yes MOLECULES="H2O" SEED=43 make run NP=4
```

---

## Hardware Auto-Detection (`HardwareProfile`)

At startup, [`src/api/hardware.py`](src/api/hardware.py) probes the environment and picks a sensible default policy. Researchers can override any decision via the environment variables above.

```python
from src.api.hardware import HardwareProfile
hw = HardwareProfile.detect()
print(hw.describe())
# Example output:
# [hw] NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation (workstation, 48.0 GB, fp64:fp32≈0.016)
#      | libs: aer-gpu, cuquantum | MPI=2 | backend=custatevec
```

What it decides:
- **CPU vs GPU** — via `nvidia-smi`; falls back to CPU if not present
- **GPU class** — consumer / workstation / datacenter (via the built-in device database)
- **Precision** — `fp64` by default; `fp32` only if the researcher explicitly opts in
- **Backend** — `custatevec` if cuQuantum+aer-gpu present, else `aer_gpu`, else `aer_cpu`
- **Maximum qubits fit** — from GPU memory (reserves ~25% for gates/Qiskit overhead)

If the `hpc_core` C++/CUDA module was built without CUDA (e.g. Docker on a laptop with no GPU), the stack transparently downgrades to CPU with a clear warning. See [`src/classical/cpu/kernel_stub.cpp`](src/classical/cpu/kernel_stub.cpp).

## Architecture

### Three-Layer Stack

```
Python API (src/api/)
   | QuantumProblem.prepare() -> Pauli Hamiltonian + parameterized ansatz
C++ Dispatcher (src/dispatcher/)
   | MPI_Ibcast parameters -> local compute -> MPI_Allreduce partial energies
CUDA Kernels (src/classical/cuda/)
   | Mixed-precision (FP32 trig -> FP64 accumulation) Pauli expectations
```

**Orchestration Layer** - Rank 0 holds the global SPSA optimizer state and broadcasts variational parameters $\theta^+$ and $\theta^-$ to all MPI ranks with `MPI_Ibcast` (non-blocking) in the C++ dispatcher and `comm.Bcast` / `comm.Allreduce` in the Python path. After the local computation, `MPI_Allreduce(SUM)` aggregates the partial energies from all ranks.

**Acceleration Layer** - Each rank constructs the full $2^n$ statevector (main per-iteration cost) and evaluates its subset of Pauli terms. If a GPU is available, statevector construction and gate operations are offloaded to NVIDIA's cuStateVec library via Qiskit Aer's GPU backend — this is the path actually used for every `simulator`/`ibm_cloud` result in this repo. The custom CUDA kernel (mixed-precision FP32 trig / FP64 tree-reduction Pauli expectation, mean-field approximation) is a separate, currently-unused evaluation path — see the Evaluation Paths table below.

**Quantum Interface Layer** - Abstracts the backend (simulator, GPU, or cloud QPU) from the upper layers. For IBM Quantum, the Python EstimatorV2 path bundles both $E(\theta^+)$ and $E(\theta^-)$ as two Primitive Unified Blocs (PUBs) in a single job, reducing QPU round-trips by 50%. The C++ path uses `std::async` for non-blocking QPU job submission via a REST client.


### Evaluation Paths

| Path | When Used | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Statevector (MPI)** | `BACKEND=simulator` | Exact statevector simulation, GPU-accelerated when available, CPU fallback. |
| **IBM QPU** | `BACKEND=ibm_cloud` | EstimatorV2 with async classical overlap during QPU RTT. |
| **C++ Dispatcher** | Layer 3 test only — not used by `simulator`/`ibm_cloud` | MPI dispatch via pybind11 bridge, CUDA kernel or CPU mean-field *approximation* (exact for diagonal Z/I terms, approximate for entangled X/Y terms — see `dispatcher.cpp`). Not validated for chemical accuracy; do not route production runs through this path without fixing that first. |


### Data Flow

`ChemistryProblem.from_registry("LiH")` -> PySCF driver -> Jordan-Wigner mapping -> Pauli Hamiltonian (631 terms)  + HWE-adaptive ansatz (96 params) -> `HPCHybridStack.vqe_optimize()` -> SPSA loop distributes $\theta^\pm$ across P ranks -> each rank evaluates its Pauli partition -> `MPI_Allreduce` sums energies -> gradient update -> repeat until convergence.

### Key Classes

| Class | File | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| `HPCHybridStack` | `src/api/interface.py` | Main entry point: MPI init, SPSA optimizer, checkpoint management, GPU/QPU routing |
| `ChemistryProblem` | `src/api/problems.py` | Molecular Hamiltonian via PySCF + Jordan-Wigner, auto selects from ansatz tier |
| `MoleculeResolver` | `src/api/molecule_resolver.py` | Registry -> raw geometry -> SMILES -> PubChem cascade |
| `HybridWorkload` | `include/stack_types.h` | C++ dispatcher interface contract |

### SPSA Optimizer Configuration

The SPSA classical optimizer is a gradient-free method that estimates the objective function gradient using only two measurements per iteration regardless of parameter count. This is well suited for NISQ hardware where each circuit evaluation is expensive.

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Perturbation $c$ | 0.1 | Fixed, appropriate for angles in $[0, 2\pi]$ |
| Step size $a$ | $0.628 / \sqrt{p/8}$ | Scales with parameter count $p$ |
| Stability constant $A$ | $0.1 \times$ max_iterations | Delays aggressive early steps |
| Decay rates $\alpha, \gamma$ | 0.602, 0.101 | Standard SPSA schedule |
| Convergence | Sliding window of 10 | Spread < 1.6 mHa (chemical accuracy threshold) |
| Initialization | $\mathcal{U}(-0.1, 0.1)$ | Near zero, keeps initial state near Hartree-Fock reference $|0\ldots0\rangle$ |
| Random seed | 42 | Fixed for reproducibility |
| Max iterations | $\max(200,\; 8 \times \text{num\_params})$ | Scales with problem size |

## GPU Acceleration

### How It Works

GPU acceleration in this stack is a **plug in option**, where the same Python code runs on CPU and GPU paths. GPU availability is autodetected at startup. For the `simulator`/`ibm_cloud` backends (i.e. every published result), the stack picks between:

1. **GPU statevector (cuStateVec)** - When an NVIDIA GPU is detected, the stack uses Qiskit Aer's GPU-accelerated statevector simulator, backed by NVIDIA's cuStateVec library (cuQuantum SDK). All gate operations (CNOT, rotations) run as GPU matrix multiplications while the full statevector resides in GPU memory.
2. **CPU fallback** —- When no GPU is available, the stack automatically falls back to Qiskit's CPU-based `Statevector` class.

A third path exists but is **not** part of this auto-selection: a custom CUDA Pauli-term kernel (mixed-precision FP32/FP64, one thread per Pauli term) reachable only through the C++ dispatcher (`hpc_core.execute()`), which the `simulator`/`ibm_cloud` backends never call. It's exercised by the Layer 3 diagnostic test only — see the Evaluation Paths table above for why it isn't chemical-accuracy-validated.


### Validated GPU Hardware

The stack has been validated on multiple GPU classes to characterize the hardware ladder. The `HardwareProfile` layer auto-detects the class and applies the appropriate policy.

| GPU | Class | Memory | Bandwidth | Where |
|-----|-------|-------:|----------:|-------|
| GTX 1650 Mobile | Consumer (Turing) | 4 GB GDDR6 | 128 GB/s | Original thesis baseline (Lambda) |
| RTX 6000 Ada | Workstation (Ada Lovelace) | 48 GB GDDR6 ECC | 960 GB/s | IE capstone cluster ✓ |
| A100 40GB SXM4 | Datacenter (Ampere) | 40 GB HBM2e | 1,555 GB/s | Lambda Cloud (planned) |
| H100 80GB SXM5 | Datacenter (Hopper) | 80 GB HBM3 | 3,350 GB/s | Lambda Cloud (planned) |

The bandwidth range (128 → 3,350 GB/s, a 26× span) exercises statevector simulation's memory-bandwidth-bound behavior (Bayraktar et al., 2023) across generations of NVIDIA hardware. Consumer-class GPUs establish a lower bound; datacenter GPUs demonstrate the ceiling.

### Lambda GPU Cloud Setup

The GPU accelerated experiments used [Lambda Cloud](https://lambdalabs.com/service/gpu-cloud) GPU instances. To replicate:

1. **Create a Lambda account** at [cloud.lambdalabs.com](https://cloud.lambdalabs.com)
2. **Launch an instance** with an NVIDIA GPU (GTX 1650 or better). Lambda provides ondemand instances with preinstalled NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit.
3. **SSH into the instance** using the key pair configured during setup:
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_lambda_key ubuntu@<instance-ip>
   ```
4. **Clone and run** the stack. The Docker image handles all CUDA/driver dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url> && cd quantum_classical_VQE_algorithm
   make build && make run NP=4           #  GPU is auto detected inside container
   ```
5. Verify GPU detection in the output:
   ```
   [Stack] GPU statevector (cuStateVec) available
   [Stack] Initialized 4 MPI rank(s), GPU=enabled, SV_backend=GPU (cuStateVec)
   ```

The Docker image (`nvidia/cuda:12.6.3-devel-ubuntu22.04` base) builds Qiskit Aer from source with the CUDA thrust backend (`AER_THRUST_BACKEND=CUDA`), so GPU acceleration will work on any NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 12.x driver support. You will need the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) installed on the host for Docker in order to access the GPU.

## Experimental Results

### Simulator VQE Accuracy (CPU, P=2)

The distributed stack was validated against four benchmark molecules with increasing complexity:

| Molecule | Qubits | Pauli Terms | Params | Energy ($E_h$) | FCI ($E_h$) | Error ($E_h$) | Chem. Accuracy? | Iterations |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------|----------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| H₂  | 4  | 15   | 24  | -1.1349 | -1.1373 | 0.0024 | Near (1.5x threshold) | 200  |
| LiH | 12 | 631  | 96  | -7.5463 | -7.8825 | 0.3362 | No   | 768  |
| BeH₂| 14 | 666  | 112 | -15.5557| -15.5951| 0.0394 | No (25x threshold) | 896  |
| H₂O | 14 | 1086 | 112 | -74.7921| -75.0124| 0.2203 | No   | 896  |

H₂ approached the 1.6 mHa chemical accuracy threshold with a 2.4 mHa error. Larger molecules require either more iterations or particle-conserving ansatzes for chemical accuracy. Notably, H₂O achieved a 0.13 mHa in a favorable SPSA trajectory at P=4 during strong scaling, demonstrating the accuracy target is reachable.

### Wall-Clock Speedup: Serial vs Distributed vs GPU

| Molecule | Serial (s) | CPU P=2 (s) | CPU Speedup | GPU P=8 (s) | GPU Speedup |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| H₂  | 0.64  | 2.25  | 0.28x | 1.13  | 0.57x |
| LiH | 41.62 | 66.54 | 0.63x | 38.74 | **1.07x** |
| BeH₂| 173.84| 155.89| **1.11x** | 141.16| **1.23x** |
| H₂O | 227.23| 193.01| **1.18x** | 150.25| **1.51x** |

Key finding: CPU only MPI distribution provides speedup only for larger molecules (BeH₂, H₂O) where Pauli-term parallelization outweighs MPI overhead. GPU acceleration is the stack's defining factor that enables continued scaling at P>=4, turning the previous CPU only 0.24x regression at P=8 into a 1.51x speedup** with GPU. This confirms Amdahl's Law where without reducing the serial fraction (statevector construction), adding more processors yields diminishing returns. With GPU accelerationm this serial fraction is reduced and allows beneficial MPI distribution 

### Strong Scaling (H₂O, 1086 Pauli Terms, 896 Iterations)

| Ranks (P) | CPU Time (s) | CPU Efficiency | GPU Time (s) | GPU Efficiency |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | 253.06 | 100% | 266.90 | 100% |
| 2 | 252.79 | 50.1% | 187.72 | 71.1% |
| 4 | 488.25 | 13.0% | 160.72 | 41.5% |
| 8 | 1038.50 | 3.0% | 150.25 | 22.2% |

CPU-only regression at P>=4 is due to redundant per-rank $O(2^n)$ statevector construction and shared-memory contention on a single Docker host. GPU acceleration reduces this cost sufficiently for MPI distribution to remain beneficial.

### Weak Scaling (Problem Size Grows with P)

| P | Molecule | Pauli Terms | Terms/Rank | CPU Time (s) | GPU Time (s) | CPU iter (s) | GPU iter (s) |
|---|----------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | H₂  | 15   | 15  | 0.051  | 0.050  | 0.005 | 0.005 |
| 2 | LiH | 631  | 316 | 0.576  | 0.719  | 0.058 | 0.072 |
| 4 | BeH₂| 666  | 167 | 2.411  | 1.793  | 0.241 | 0.179 |
| 8 | H₂O | 1086 | 136 | 14.398 | 2.389  | 1.440 | 0.239 |

GPU acceleration reduced H₂O at P=8 from 14.4s to 2.4s (6x improvement), with per-iteration GPU time remaining stable (0.005-0.239s) versus the CPU path's growth from 0.005s to 1.440s.

### Communication Masking

The masking metric $M = T_{\text{accel}} / T_{\text{comm}}$ measures how well classical computation hides communication latency:

| Path | M Range | Interpretation |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Simulator P=1 | 2,200 - 9,000 | Compute dominates by ~ 3 orders of magnitude |
| Simulator P=2 | 12 - 5,400 | Compute dominates, higher variance from MPI timing |
| IBM QPU | < 1 | QPU RTT (32-60s) dominates, masking will require larger molecules |

$M \gg 1$ across all simulator runs confirms that distributing classical subroutines across MPI ranks does not introduce a communication bottleneck as prediced by the "Communication Wall" (Weder et al., 2021).

### IBM Quantum QPU (ibm_marrakesh, H₂)

The stack completed 10 VQE iterations on IBM's 156-qubit `ibm_marrakesh` Heron processor:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Best energy | -0.171 $E_h$ (FCI: -1.137 $E_h$) |
| Error | 0.966 $E_h$ |
| Avg time/iteration | 42.1s (dominated by QPU RTT: 31.9-60.4s) |
| Shots | 4096 per circuit |
| Error mitigation | T-REx (resilience level 1) |

**The large error is expected** 10 iterations is insufficient for SPSA convergence, as simulator required 200 for H₂, introduced shot noise means statistical uncertainty (~0.016 $E_h$), and T-REx only handles readout errors (not addressing gate errors or decoherence). However, the energy showed a consistent downward trend from -0.111 to -0.171 $E_h$, confirming the SPSA optimizer functions correctly on physical quantum hardware and the full middleware pipeline (transpilation, PUB batching, cloud submission, MPI coordination) operates end-to-end without failure.

10 iterations only is due to the limited time (10 min) of QPU access provided by the IBM free access plan. With access to unlimited QPU runtime, the predicted results will improve significantly. 

### Success Metrics Summary

| Category | Metric | Threshold | Observed | Status |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| System Performance | $T_{\text{total}}$ | 1.5x speedup | 1.51x (H₂O, GPU P=8) | **Achieved** |
| Latency Masking | $M$ | $M \geq 1$ | $M = 12$-$9{,}000$ (simulator) | **Achieved** |
| Throughput | iter/s | > serial baseline | 4.65 vs 3.94 (H₂O, P=2) | **Achieved** |
| Hardware Efficiency | $E$ | >= 70% at P=2 | 71.1% (GPU P=2) | **Achieved** |
| Scientific Fidelity | $\Delta E$ | <= 1.6 mHa | 2.4 mHa (H₂); 0.13 mHa at P=4 | **Partial** |
| Resilience | $R_{\text{time}}$ | < 60s recovery | Checkpoint restart verified | **Achieved** |

---

## Testing and Stress Tests

`make trial` runs 7 layer diagnostic suite:

| Layer | What It Tests |
|-------|---------------|
| 1. MPI Bridge | Rank initialization, `MPI_Barrier` synchronization |
| 2. Problem Preparation | H₂ Hamiltonian construction, Pauli decomposition, ansatz building |
| 3. C++ Dispatcher | Single dispatch through pybind11 bridge, MPI broadcast + reduce |
| 4. VQE Loop | 10 iteration SPSA optimization, convergence detection |
| 5. Checkpoint Resilience | Save $\theta$ at iter 5, restart from checkpoint, verify continuity |
| 6. Latency Spiking | Random 0.5-2.0s delays injected on odd ranks, verify MPI stays synchronized |
| 7. Drop-Out Recovery | Deletes checkpoint at iter 10, recovers from iter 5, verify no data loss |

### Checkpoint Resilience

The stack checkpoints the global $\theta$ state every 5 iterations to `.npy` files with a rolling retention of the 5 most recent checkpoints. 

| Phase | Iterations | Start Energy ($E_h$) | End Energy ($E_h$) |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Initial run (1-5) | 5 | -0.963 | -1.071 |
| Post-restart (6-10) | 5 | -1.085 | -1.109 |

The optimizer correctly resumes from the SPSA schedule position ($k=6$ not $k=1$) and the energy trajectory continues descending without loss of convergence progress.

### Stress Test: Latency Spiking

Random delays of 0.5-2.0s were injected into odd MPI ranks in 10 iterations for H₂. All iterations completed without MPI timeout or deadlock, all returned energies were finite, and `MPI_Allreduce` synchronization was maintained.

### Stress Test: Drop-Out Recovery

After 10 iterations, iteration 10 checkpoint was deleted. The stack detected the missing checkpoint, fell back to iteration 5, and resumed optimization from the correct $\theta$ state and SPSA schedule position. The postrecovery energy trajectory continued descending which confirms no optimization progress was permanently lost.

## Results Output

All runs automatically save structured output to `results/<hardware-slug>/`, organized by GPU model first (so runs from different hardware are never mixed), then by category:

```
results/
  <hardware-slug>/       # derived from nvidia-smi, e.g. a100-sxm4-40gb, rtx-6000-ada-generation, cpu-only
    simulator/            # make run - JSON + full iteration logs
    ibm/                  # make run-ibm - JSON + QPU job logs
    scaling/              # make scaling / make weak-scaling - summary + logs
    baseline/             # make baseline - JSON + logs (serial_baseline.py always uses cpu-only/)
  plots/                  # aggregate figures, hardware-agnostic
```

See `results/README.md` for the full layout rationale and how `HardwareProfile.results_slug()` (`src/api/hardware.py`) derives the folder name automatically.

Each file is timestamped (for example `simulator_20260319_212106.json`) and includes git commit hash, GPU name/class, hostname, per-molecule energies, convergence histories, and timing data. JSON results are never overwritten.

Analyze results with:
```bash
python benchmarks/run_analysis.py            # summary table
python benchmarks/run_analysis.py --plot     # convergence plots (requires matplotlib)
python benchmarks/aggregate_scaling.py --hw <hardware-slug> --seed 42   # strong-scaling table, one hardware at a time
python benchmarks/aggregate_seeds.py --hw <hardware-slug>               # multi-seed median + range, one hardware at a time
```
`--hw` is required whenever more than one hardware folder exists under `results/` — both aggregators refuse to silently average wall-clock times across different GPUs.

## Reproducibility

Every result in this repository can be regenerated from the committed raw JSON files. The workflow is designed so a reviewer with only a laptop (no cluster, no GPU) can verify all published tables and figures.

### Verify the code from a clean install (~15 min)

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd quantum_classical_VQE_algorithm
docker --version                              # any recent Docker Desktop
make build                                    # ~10 min, builds Qiskit Aer from source
make trial NP=2                               # ~5 min, expect: Tests passed: 7 / 7
```

The trial exercises MPI + statevector + checkpointing + stress tests. Passing 7/7 confirms the stack is functional on any Docker host.

### Regenerate paper tables from raw JSONs (no compute needed)

The result JSONs cited in the paper are all committed under `results/<hardware-slug>/` (e.g. `results/rtx-6000-ada-generation/`, `results/a100-sxm4-40gb/`, `results/cpu-only/` — see `results/README.md`), and are timestamped with git-commit-hash provenance. To rebuild the tables:

```bash
python3 benchmarks/aggregate_seeds.py --hw <hardware-slug>          # multi-seed median + range
python3 benchmarks/aggregate_scaling.py --hw <hardware-slug>        # strong-scaling table
python3 benchmarks/run_analysis.py --plot                           # convergence + accuracy plots
python3 docs/render_scaling_breakthrough.py                         # CPU-vs-GPU efficiency figure
```

### Reproduce the RTX 6000 Ada benchmarks (needs a similar HPC / cloud GPU)

```bash
bash scripts/install_native.sh          # or run inside Docker with --gpus all
make slurm-multi-seed                    # n=3 statistical run (or SEEDS="42 43 44 45 46" for n=5)
make slurm-scaling                       # P=1,2,4,8 strong scaling on GPU
make aggregate-seeds                     # produces publication table
```

Tested end-to-end on:
- **IE University capstone cluster** (Slurm, CUDA 12.4, RTX 6000 Ada 48 GB) — see `scripts/install_native.sh`
- **Laptop CPU fallback** via Docker (Linux Mint, no NVIDIA GPU) — passes 7/7 on `make trial`
- **Lambda Cloud A100-SXM4-40GB** — full strong/weak scaling sweep (P=1,2,4,8), seeds 42-46, `results/a100-sxm4-40gb/`

### Statistical methodology

Simulator results are reported as median ± [min, max] over n independent SPSA random seeds at fixed hyperparameters. Multi-seed sampling is critical because SPSA convergence at moderate qubit counts (LiH, 12 qubits, 96 params) is bimodal — the best-of-N seed can reach near-FCI accuracy while others land far from ground state. See `benchmarks/aggregate_seeds.py` for the aggregation logic.

### Tagged releases

Reference points for reproducibility:
- **`v1.0-gpu-validated`** — full GPU + MPI + cuStateVec trial passes on RTX 6000 Ada from a clean `install_native.sh`
- **`v1.1-multi-seed`** — n=5 seeded simulator statistics + GPU strong scaling on RTX 6000 Ada

## Future Work

The following extensions are planned to address current limitations and broaden applicability:

- **UCCSD Ansatz Integration** - UCCSD ansatz preserves particle number, eliminating HWE's variational principle violations. UCCSD is already architecturally supported in the stack's ansatz tier system but had encountered compatibility challenges with Qiskit Nature's gate decomposition pipeline. Resolving this would remove best-physical-energy tracking and shows potential to significantly improve chemical accuracy on larger molecules.

- **Advanced Quantum Error Mitigation** - IBM QPU path uses T-REx (resilience level 1), which only handles measurement readout errors. Integrating Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) or Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) with Qiskit's resilience level 2+ would reduce any gate errors and decoherence without needing hardware changes, improving QPU accuracy.

- **Multi-Node Deployment with InfiniBand** - All current scaling experiments run on a single Docker host with MPI ranks sharing CPU cores and memory bandwidth. Future deployment on a multi-node cluster with InfiniBand interconnect would eliminate the shared memory contention that was observed at P>=4 and will provide a true measurement of the stack's distributed scaling capabilities.

- **Data-Center GPU Benchmarking** - GTX 1650 Mobile (128 GB/s GDDR6) represents a lower bound on GPU performance. Bayraktar et al. (2023) established that statevector simulation is memory-bandwidth-bound, so an A100 (2,039 GB/s HBM2e) would provide over 15x the memory bandwidth for substantially greater speedups on larger molecules.

- **Application Extensibility** - The stack already includes a `FinanceProblem` class that maps portfolio optimization to a QUBO/Ising Hamiltonian as the middleware is not limited to quantum chemistry. Future work will extend this to combinatorial optimization (MaxCut, TSP) and materials science (periodic Hamiltonians) using same MPI distribution and QPU dispatch infrastructure.

- **Hardware Portability**  - The current dual path architecture (C++ dispatcher for MPI coordination, Python primitives for QPU access) gives a natural extension point for a plug in feature for additional quantum backends such as Amazon Braket and Azure Quantum.

## Known Limitations

- **$O(2^n)$ per-rank statevector cost** — Each MPI rank independently constructs the full statevector; only Pauli-term evaluations are distributed. Primary scaling bottleneck; reduced by GPU acceleration but not eliminated. Future statevector-tiling via multi-GPU cuStateVec is architecturally supported.
- **HWE particle-number violation** — SPSA can drive the HWE ansatz into unphysical sectors below FCI at higher qubit counts. Mitigated via near-zero initialization + best-physical-energy tracking; fully resolved by particle-conserving ansatzes (UCCSD — see Future Work).
- **Single-host MPI in the current benchmarks** — Reported scaling data uses ranks on one node with shared CPU cache/memory. Multi-node cluster deployment with InfiniBand would reduce shared-memory contention observed at P≥4 on CPU. GPU-accelerated MPI at higher rank counts is stable on the RTX 6000 Ada single-host configuration.
- **IBM Open Plan QPU budget** — 10 min/month per account, limiting statistical robustness on the QPU path. Multi-seed methodology (`benchmarks/aggregate_seeds.py`) applies to QPU runs but is budget-constrained; publication statistics rely primarily on simulator seeds.
- **`hpc_core.so` requires CUDA-compatible host compiler** — CUDA 12.4 requires GCC ≤ 13. Pinned in `environment.yml`; `install_native.sh` auto-configures the correct compiler on supported clusters.
